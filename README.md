Since the browser is very slow use curl to get the required contents or clone to repository and use the required instruction set.<br>
All the markdown files are named based on their usecase for example installations provide guide to install basic packages while docker.md provide an installation guide to docker.<br>
*Note* All of the commands in markdown files are not yet battletested so use at own risk.

## curl command

```bash
